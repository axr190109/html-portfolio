<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I'm Ajay Rao. I was born in South Brunswick, New Jersey, but now I live in McKinney, Texas. I'm currently a Master's student studying Software Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas, and I have about a year left before I graduate.</p>

<p>I also did my undergrad at UT Dallas, where I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in Spring 2024. I've always enjoyed coding and figuring out how things work behind the scenes, which is what got me into software development in the first place.</p>

<p>Right now, I am taking this awesome web development course by Angela Yu to learn more about building websites and full-stack applications. This "About Me" page is one of the projects from the courseâ€”so if you're reading this, you're probably seeing my progress in action!</p>
